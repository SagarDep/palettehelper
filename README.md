Palette Helper is a simple utility app made to generate color palettes of images using Google's fantastic [Palette](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/graphics/Palette.html) library. It's mostly a for-fun pet project, and intended as such for anyone that wants to see what kind of results the library churns out for images. I hope it might also be useful to any designers that want to design a color palette around a given scene or image.

The flow is pretty simple. You can either choose to open an image from storage, take one from your camera (if you feel like capturing a scene), or enter an image URL. You can also share an image with the app via the system's intent system either directly or via URL.

For fun, I opted to write this all in Kotlin. Assuming you install the Kotlin plugin, this should be easy to import and run in Android Studio.

Special thanks to [@emilsjolander](https://github.com/emilsjolander) for the icon/graphic designs!
